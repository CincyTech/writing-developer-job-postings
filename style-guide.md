# Cincytech slack community Job Description Style Guide

Finding the right person for a job is difficult. And writing a job descriptions
to attract that person is hard. Provide too much detail and no one will ever
read it. Provide too little detail and no one would dare apply. It's an art
form, and attempting to strike a balance between too little and too much can be
time consuming and the results can be unpredictable.


This document is an attempt to summarize what we, the cincytech slack community
feel is a good job description for jobs in software development. It is not meant
to be exhaustive or authoritative, instead it is merely a set of principles to
keep in mind when you are writing the job to find the perfect person you need
for the job.

## Anatomy of a good job description


If possible, a job description should contain most of the following parts.

- Job title
- Company Description
- Compensation
- Team Description
- Responsibilities
- Day to day tasks
- Technology Stack

### Dos and Don'ts

The remainder of this section will focus on each part individually.

### Job Title

A job title should be brief because it is often used as the heading of a
document or page. It is the first thing a candidate will notice and attracts
them to your job description.

A job title is a brief description of the overall type of job you are looking
for. It needs to be brief because it is often used as the title of the document
and it is good to be descriptive because often this will be the first bit of
information a candidate sees in a search result. The more attention grabbing the
better.

#### Examples

"Web Developer" is fine but... "Front-End Developer" or "Full-Stack Developer" is better.


Do mention the main language or framework if possible. 

"Ruby Web Developer" or "Rails Developer"

Don't use internal job titles such as "JAVA DEVELOPER-3", no one outside your
company will know what that means, and it will likely not match any candidates
search criteria.

Don't use "Rockstar" or "Ninja", it is off putting to most professionals now to
be referred to as such.
