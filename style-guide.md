# Cincytech slack community Job Description Style Guide

Finding the right person for a job is difficult. And writing a job descriptions
to attract that person is hard. Provide too much detail and no one will ever
read it. Provide too little detail and no one would dare apply. It's an art
form, and attempting to strike a balance between too little and too much can be
time consuming and the results can be unpredictable.


This document is an attempt to summarize what we, the cincytech slack community
feel is a good job description for jobs in software development. It is not meant
to be exhaustive or authoritative, instead it is merely a set of principles to
keep in mind when you are writing the job to find the perfect person you need
for the job.

## Anatomy of a good job description


If possible, a job description should contain most of the following parts.

- Job title
- Company Description
- Compensation
- Team Description
- Responsibilities
- Day to day tasks
- Technology Stack

### Dos and Don'ts

The remainder of this section will focus on each part individually.

### Job Title

A job title should be brief because it is often used as the heading of a
document or page. It is the first thing a candidate will notice and attracts
them to your job description.

A job title is a brief description of the overall type of job you are looking
for. It needs to be brief because it is often used as the title of the document
and it is good to be descriptive because often this will be the first bit of
information a candidate sees in a search result. The more attention grabbing the
better.

#### Examples

"Web Developer" is fine but... "Front-End Developer" or "Full-Stack Developer" is better.


Do mention the main language or framework if possible. 

"Ruby Web Developer" or "Rails Developer"

Don't use internal job titles such as "JAVA DEVELOPER-3", no one outside your
company will know what that means, and it will likely not match any candidates
search criteria or standout in the search results.

Don't use "Rockstar" or "Ninja", it is off putting to most professionals now to
be referred to as such at least in the cincytech slack community.

### Company Description

A company description is a paragraph describing the domain the company operates
in. It may also include the culture/values of the company. It does not
necessarily need to mention the name of the company but that would be ideal.

A company description is necessary for a couple of reasons.

1. It implies the nature of the work. 

If you're a design agency, your work is likely project based and for external clients. Some people prefer that type of work, some do not. 

If you're a startup, the culture is likely vastly different than that of a financial institution. Some people may prefer the excitement and risk of working for a startup, some may prefer the stability and culture of a bank. 


2. It helps save you and the candidates time. 


#### Examples

"We are a startup working to make the internet of things more secure."

Do mention location...

"We are a startup in Cincinnati Ohio working to make the internet of things more secure."

Do provide a link for more information if possible.

"We are a startup in Cincinnati Ohio working to make the internet of things more secure. [find out more](http://google.com)"

Don't just copy/paste your mission statement. Those are rarely understood outside the company. 

Don't just leave out the company description.

### Compensation

The compensation section should include whether the part time/full time/contract/volunteer and list a range of salary or hourly rate. Benefits offered is also good.

Even if the rate is negotiable, it's better to be upfront about what you are offering for the position. Lots of time and effort can be wasted interviewing only to find out that your compensation expectations and the candidates are impossible to align. 


#### Examples

"This is a full time position with a salary range of 50K-75K, we also offer health dental and vision"

Don't ....

"Negotiable"

As we all know everything is negotiable

### Team Description

Like the company description, the team description briefly describes in a paragraph what team the candidate would be working on.

Depending on the size of the company, the team description could also be the company description. But it is important to mention because it provides extra context as to the nature of the job and culture.

"Working on our product development team" vs. "Help Desk Support team" imply 2 entirely different styles of development work.


#### Examples

"The candidate will be working on our product development team"

DO: If it is product development a link to find out more about the product would be helpful if it's available.

"The candidate will be working on our product development team on our [Analytics Product](http://google.com)"

Do: mention the development methodology/culture if that's important to you in selecting a candidate
