Finding the right person for a job is difficult. And writing a job descriptions
to attract that person is hard. Provide too much detail and no one will ever
read it. Provide too little detail and no one would dare apply. It's an art
form, and attempting to strike a balance between too little and too much can be
time consuming and the results can be unpredictable.

feel is a good job description for jobs in software development. It is not meant
to be exhaustive or authoritative, instead it is merely a set of principles to
keep in mind when you are writing the job to find the perfect person you need
